# 📝 About the Project

The **Weather App** is a modern React-based web application designed to provide users with accurate and user-friendly weather forecasts. Leveraging the power of the **OpenWeatherMap API**, the app displays a 5-day forecast for cities across India, with data including:

- 🌡️ Temperature highs and lows  
- ☁️ Weather conditions  
- 💧 Humidity  
- 🌬️ Wind speed  

It also showcases additional useful information such as:

- 🕒 Local date and time  
- 🏙️ City population  

What makes this app unique is its integration of real-time weather data with static local data (like city info), creating a fast and responsive experience without overloading API calls. With clean visuals and an intuitive layout, it's perfect for users who want quick, glanceable weather updates.
